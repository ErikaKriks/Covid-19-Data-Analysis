# Covid-19-Data-Analysis
This was my first capstone project at Turing College. The purpose of this project was to learn to perform EDA using **Python (Numpy, Pandas)** and visualize data using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** packages.

### GOAL
Imagine that you are one of the best data scientists in your country. The president of your country asked you to analyze the COVID-19 patient-level data of South Korea and prepare your homeland for the next wave of the pandemic. You, as the lead data scientist of your country have to __create and prove a plan of fighting the pandemics in your country by analyzing the provided data__. You must get the most critical insights using learned data science techniques and present them to the lead of your country.
